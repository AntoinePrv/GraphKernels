# Description

This folder contains Matlab scripts for compting various kernels from the family of random walk kernels. These include:
- the random walk kernel for unlabeled graphs (RWkernel.m) 
- labeled random walk kernel (lRWkernel.m)
- labeled random walk kernel up to p-step random walks (untilpRWkernel.m)
