# GraphKernels

Code for implementing different Graph Kernels

# Summary

This repository contains Matlab scripts for computing several graph kernels for graphs with unlabeled or 
categorically labeled nodes and scripts for evaluating the SVM classification performance using 
precomputed kernels using cross-validation. In the folder "data" we provide 5 data sets of undirected labeled graphs in Matlab format for graph 
classification which can be used for testing the scripts. More information, code and data can be found on the following website. https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/research/machine-learning/graph-kernels.html

# Usage

"help X.m" executed in Matlab will display instructions on the usage of X.m for any script X.m

# Implemented Graph Kernels

For unlabeled graphs the following implementations are available:
- the family of graphlet kernels (subfolders allgraphlets, connectedgraphlets, samplinggraphlets) from [6]
- the random walk kernel (RWkernel.m) from [7]
- the shortest path kernel (SPkernel.m) from [1]

For labeled graphs the following implementations are available:
- 3 kernels from the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel family: the WL subtree (WL.m), the WL shortest path (WLspdelta.m), 
  and the WL edge (WLedge.m) kernels from [5]
- the labeled 3-node graphlet kernel (l3graphletkernel.m) - extension of an algorithm in [6]
- the labeled random walk kernel (lRWkernel.m) from [7]
- the labeled random walk kernel based on walks up to size p (untilpRWkernel.m) - extension of [2],[3]
- the labeled shortest path kernel (lSPkernel.m) from [1]
- the Ramon and Gaertner subtree kernel (RGkernel.m) from [4]

Note that all WL kernels also support unlabeled graphs.
