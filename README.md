# GraphKernels

Code for implementing different Graph Kernels

# Summary

This repository contains Matlab scripts for computing several graph kernels for graphs with unlabeled or 
categorically labeled nodes and scripts for evaluating the SVM classification performance using 
precomputed kernels using cross-validation. In the folder "data" we provide 5 data sets of undirected labeled graphs in Matlab format for graph 
classification which can be used for testing the scripts.

# Usage

"help X.m" executed in Matlab will display instructions on the usage of X.m for any script X.m
