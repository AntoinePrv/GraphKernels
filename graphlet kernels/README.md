#Description

This folder contains Matlab scripts for computing various kernels from the family of graphlet kernels. The script l3graphletkernel.m computes the labeled 3-node graphlet kernel. The other kernels are suitable 
for unweighted unlabeled graphs. These are:
- all 3 and 4-node graphlet kernels (allkernel.m in allgraphlets folder)
- all 3,4,5-node graphlet kernels that use sampling (gestkernelK.m for K={3,4,5} in samplinggraphlets folder)
- connected 3,4,5-node graphlet kernels (connectedkernel.m in connectedgraphlets folder)

The other scripts are auxiliary.

The folder also includes 3 pdf files which illustrate graphlet kernels. 

# Usage
Typing "help script_name" will give you information about the input and output of the corresponding script.
