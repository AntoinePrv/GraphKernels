# Description

This folder contains Matlab script for implementing different instances of the Weisfeiler - Lehman Kernels. 
In particular:

- WL.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel
- WLedge.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman edge kernel
- WLspdelta.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman shortest path kernel (with exact matching of shortest path lengths) on graphs 
with unweighted unlabeled edges, with/without discrete node labels.
